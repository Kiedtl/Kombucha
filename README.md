## What is Kombucha?

Kombucha is a command-line installer and uninstaller, much like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Kombucha was created with the goal of having a easy-to-use command-line utility that could be used to install a tool. Kombucha tries, like Scoop, to do away with UAC popups, installation wizards, MSI files, and kitten roasting.

## Concepts in Kombucha

### Bottles

Bottles are just Kombucha-jargon for a bottle or app. Bottles are stored in this repository in the `kombucha-bottles` directory. When you request an app to be installed, Kombucha looks up the `bottle.json` app manifest file in the `shelf/<app-name>/` directory. The `bottle.json` file contains the following information:

-   TITLE
-   NAME
-   HOMEPAGE
-   DESCRIPTION
-   Author(s)
-   Readme URL (plain text format)
-   LICENSE NAME
-   LICENSE URL
-   LATEST VERSION
-   DOWNLOAD TYPE (MSI, ZIP, EXE)
-   32-BIT DOWNLOAD URL
-   64-BIT DOWNLOAD URL
-   EXECUTABLE FILE NAME FOR THE APP

The app manifest will look something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "yummy-cake",
    "title": "Yummy Cake",
    "homepage": "http://www.yummy-cake.org/",
    "description": "This is a sample file.",

        }
    },

### Shelves

Similar to Buckets in Scoop, Shelves are Git repositories somewhere up in the cloud that are stuffed with app manifests (i.e. `bottle.json` files) for bottles that you can download and install. The main Shelf is located in this repository in the `shelf` directory. You can create your own shelf.
